Slidify
=======

About
-----
Slidify is a Greasemonkey-style script to turn any image thread into a full-browser slideshow. It currently works only with 4chan, though the goal is to make it work with multiple image-focused sites, either through parameterizing the correct images via a jQuery selector or Javascript function, or via a more complicated algorithm to determine relevant content images (as opposed to say, ads).

Install
-------
Go to http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/125386 and click on the green "Install" button.

Requirements
------------
It should run in any browser that supports userscripts, which includes Firefox and Chrome, but has only currently been tested in Chrome.

Known bugs
----------
Occasionally, when closing and restarting a slideshow, it refuses to play correctly.
