Slidify
=======

About
-----
Slidify is a Greasemonkey script to turn any image thread into a full-browser slideshow. It currently works with Tumblr and 4chan, though the goal is to make it work with more image-focused sites, either through parameterizing the correct images via a jQuery selector or Javascript function, or via a more complicated algorithm to determine relevant content images (as opposed to say, ads). 

It has options for random ordering, slide speed, and shrinking images to fit the screen. To get a fullscreen view, use your browser options, e.g., for Chrome and Firefox on a Mac, it's Shift+Cmd+F. Under Windows, it should be F11.

Install
-------
Go to http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/125386 and click on the green "Install" button.

Requirements
------------
Tested in Chrome and Firefox, though only on a Mac. I've also tested it with the 4chan Chrome extension, and it plays nice with it.
